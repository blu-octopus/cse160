# Assignment 5a: Exploring a High-Level Graphics Library

Created a scene using three.js, a high-level graphics library for WebGL. The scene includes a samurai capybara, a tori gate, and a bridge. The scene is interactive and the user can move the camera around the scene. I used GLTF over obj models because it is a more modern format that supports animations and other features that obj does not.
